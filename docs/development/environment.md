# Environment

## Development

This plugin contains both a server and web app portion.

Use `make dist` to build distributions of the plugin that you can upload to a Mattermost server. Use `make check-style` to check the style. Use `make deploy` to deploy the plugin to your local server.

For additional information on developing plugins, refer to [our plugin developer documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/).

To test your changes against Jira locally, we recommend starting a 14-day trial for Jira Software Cloud, if you don't have a Jira project to test against. More information can be found here: [https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/try](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/try).
