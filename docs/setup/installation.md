# Installation

### Requirements

* For Jira 2.1 Mattermost Server v5.14+ is required \(certain plugin APIs became available\)
* For Jira 2.0 Mattermost Server v5.12+ is required

### Marketplace Installation

1. Go to **Main Menu > Plugin Marketplace** in Mattermost.
2. Search for "Jira" or manually find the plugin from the list and click **Install**.
3. After the plugin has downloaded and been installed, click the **Configure** button.

### Manual Installation

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the latest [plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console > Plugin Management**. The releases on this page are the same used by the Marketplace.
