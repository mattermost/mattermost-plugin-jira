description: Connect your Jira account with Mattermost to speed up your daily workflow

# Getting Started

To get started with the Jira/Mattermost connector is easy.  You'll first need to connect your Jira account with your Mattermost account so the system can perform actions such as searching, viewing and creating Jira issues on your behalf. 

1. Go into any channel within mattermost \(don't worry, no one else will see this\) and type `/jira connect` 
2. Follow the link that gets presented to you - it will bring you to your Jira server
3. Click the "Allow" button

You may notice that when you type `/` a menu pops up - these are called **Slash Commands** and bring the functionality of Jira \(and other integrations\) to your fingertips.
