This plugin supports a two-way integration between Mattermost and Jira. For a stable production release, please download the latest version [in the Releases tab](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases) and follow the [installation](https://mattermost.gitbook.io/plugin-jira/setup/installation) and [configuration](https://mattermost.gitbook.io/plugin-jira/setup/configuration) instructions.

This plugin supports Jira Core and Jira Software products for Server, Data Center, and Cloud platforms. It has been tested with versions 7 and 8.

**Support for multiple Jira instances is available in Jira plugin v3.0 and later. The feature is configured using [Administrator Slash Commands](https://mattermost.gitbook.io/plugin-jira/administrator-guide/administrator-slash-commands). Note that versions v3.0.0 and v3.0.1 of the plugin require an E20 Enterprise license to use this feature. The feature is now available for Mattermost E20, Professional, and Enterprise licenses.**
