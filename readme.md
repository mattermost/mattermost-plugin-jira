# Mattermost/Jira Plugin

This plugin supports a two-way integration between Mattermost and Jira. Jira Core and Jira Software products, for Server, Data Center, and Cloud platforms are supported. It has been tested with versions 7 and 8.

For versions v3.0 and later of this plugin, support for multiple Jira instances is offered for Mattermost Enterprise Edition. Note that for versions v3.0.0 and v3.0.1 of this plugin, an E20 license is required to set up multiple Jira instances.
