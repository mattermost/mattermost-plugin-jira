## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Jira Cloud (Core + Software)

#### 3.1.1 Mattermost

1. Download this binary: https://s3.amazonaws.com/mattermost-public-plugins-kubernetes/jira-test-2.0.0.tar.gz
2. Go to **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Management** and upload the plugin from step 1. If you don't have the ability to upload plugins, uploads may be disabled on your server. To enable them, set **PluginSettings > EnableUploads** to `true` in your `config.json` file.
3. Once uploaded, the Jira plugin will appear in a list of installed plugins. Click **Enable** to enable it.
4. Go to **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Management > Jira**, select the username that this plugin is attached to, generate a **Secret** and hit **Save**.
   - You may optionally create a new user account for your Jira plugin, which can act as a bot account posting Jira updates to Mattermost channels.

#### 3.1.2 Jira

As a Jira administrator, you have two steps to configure the plugin:

#### 3.1.3 Jira - Deploy via Jira AppConnect

1. As a Jira System Administrator, go to **Jira Settings > Apps > Manage Apps**. 
  - For older versions of Jira, go to **Administration > Applications > Add-ons > Manage add-ons**

2. Click **Settings** at bottom of page and enable development mode, and apply this change.
  - Enabling development mode allows you to install apps that are not from the Atlassian Marketplace.
  - Mattermost has opted not to publish to Atlassian Marketplace, as we don’t have an efficient way to provide a callback URL for the app in the marketplace, to enable user-specific interactions between the Mattermost server and Jira cloud instance.

3. Click **Upload app**, then enter the Atlassian Connect app descriptor in the form https://SITEURL/plugins/jira//ac/atlassian-connect.json where `SITEURL` is your [Mattermost Site URL](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#site-url). Select **Upload**.

4. Wait for the app to install.

You're all set. Users can now connect their Mattermost account with Jira using `/jira connect`.

#### 3.1.4 Jira - Configure Webhooks

Only the Jira System Admin has permissions to link a Jira project to a Mattermost channel via webhooks. We are planning to allow anyone with access to subscribe a Jira project to a Mattermost channel via `/jira subscribe`.

1. As a Jira System Administrator, go to **Jira Settings > System > WebHooks**.
  - For older versions of Jira, click the gear icon in bottom left corner, then go to **Advanced > WebHooks**.

2. Click **Create a WebHook** to create a new webhook. Choose a unique name and add the JIRA webhook URL https://SITEURL/plugins/jira/webhook?secret=WEBHOOKSECRET&team=TEAMURL&channel=CHANNELURL as the URL.
  - Make sure to replace `TEAMURL` and `CHANNELURL` with the Mattermost team URL and channel URL you want the JIRA events to post to. The values should be in lower case.
  - Moreover, replace `SITEURL` with the site URL of your Mattermost instance, and `WEBHOOKSECRET` with the secret generated in Mattermost via **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Jira**

For instance, if the team URL is `contributors`, channel URL is `town-square` and site URL is `https://community.mattermost.com`, and the generated webhook secret is `5JlVk56KPxX629ujeU3MOuxaiwsPzLwh`, then the final webhook URL would be

```
https://community.mattermost.com/plugins/jira/webhook?secret=5JlVk56KPxX629ujeU3MOuxaiwsPzLwh&team=contributors&channel=town-square
```

3. (Optional) Set a description and a custom JQL query to determine which types of tickets trigger events. For more information on JQL queries, refer to the [Atlassian help documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html).

4. Finally, set which issue events send messages to Mattermost channels. The following are supported:

 - Issue: Created, Updated, Deleted
 - Comment: Created, Updated, Deleted

### 3.2 Jira Server (Core + Software)

#### 3.2.1 Mattermost

1. Download this binary: https://s3.amazonaws.com/mattermost-public-plugins-kubernetes/jira-test-2.0.0.tar.gz
2. Go to **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Management** and upload the plugin from step 1. If you don't have the ability to upload plugins, uploads may be disabled on your server. To enable them, set **PluginSettings > EnableUploads** to `true` in your `config.json` file.
3. Once uploaded, the Jira plugin will appear in a list of installed plugins. Click **Enable** to enable it.
4. Go to **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Management > Jira**, select the username that this plugin is attached to, and enter your Jira Server URL.
   - You may optionally create a new user account for your Jira plugin, which can act as a bot account posting Jira updates to Mattermost channels.

#### 3.2.2 Jira

As a Jira administrator, you have two steps to configure the plugin:

#### 3.2.3 Jira - Deploy via Jira Application Links

1. In Mattermost, post a command `/jira instance add server <your-jira-server-url>`. This generates the consumer key and public key used on a later step.
2. As a Jira System Administrator, go to **Jira Settings > Applications > Application Links**.
3. Enter your Mattermost URL as the application link, then click **Create new link**.
4. In **Configure Application URL** screen, confirm your Mattermost URL is included as the application URL. Ignore any displayed errors and click **Continue**.
5. In **Link Applications** screen, set the following values:
  - **Application Name**: Mattermost
  - **Application Type**: Generic Application
6. Check the **Create incoming link** value, then click **Continue**.
7. In the following **Link Applications** screen, set the following values:
  - **Consumer Key**: Copy the value generated in step 1 for this field.
  - **Consumer Name**: Mattermost
  - **Public Key**: Copy the value generated in step 1 for this field.
8. Click **Continue**.

You're all set. Users can now connect their Mattermost account with Jira using `/jira connect`.

#### 3.1.4 Jira - Configure Webhooks

Only the Jira System Admin has permissions to link a Jira project to a Mattermost channel via webhooks. We are planning to allow anyone with access to subscribe a Jira project to a Mattermost channel via `/jira subscribe`.

1. As a Jira System Administrator, go to **Jira Settings > System > WebHooks**.
  - For older versions of Jira, click the gear icon in bottom left corner, then go to **Advanced > WebHooks**.

2. Click **Create a WebHook** to create a new webhook. Choose a unique name and add the JIRA webhook URL https://SITEURL/plugins/jira/webhook?secret=WEBHOOKSECRET&team=TEAMURL&channel=CHANNELURL as the URL.
  - Make sure to replace `TEAMURL` and `CHANNELURL` with the Mattermost team URL and channel URL you want the JIRA events to post to. The values should be in lower case.
  - Moreover, replace `SITEURL` with the site URL of your Mattermost instance, and `WEBHOOKSECRET` with the secret generated in Mattermost via **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Jira**

For instance, if the team URL is `contributors`, channel URL is `town-square` and site URL is `https://community.mattermost.com`, and the generated webhook secret is `5JlVk56KPxX629ujeU3MOuxaiwsPzLwh`, then the final webhook URL would be

```
https://community.mattermost.com/plugins/jira/webhook?secret=5JlVk56KPxX629ujeU3MOuxaiwsPzLwh&team=contributors&channel=town-square
```

3. (Optional) Set a description and a custom JQL query to determine which types of tickets trigger events. For more information on JQL queries, refer to the [Atlassian help documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html).

4. Finally, set which issue events send messages to Mattermost channels. The following are supported:

 - Issue: Created, Updated, Deleted
 - Comment: Created, Updated, Deleted

## 4. Developing

This plugin contains both a server and web app portion.

Use `make dist` to build distributions of the plugin that you can upload to a Mattermost server.
Use `make check-style` to check the style.
Use `make deploy` to deploy the plugin to your local server.

For additional information on developing plugins, refer to [our plugin developer documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/).

To test your changes against Jira locally, we recommend starting a 14-day trial for Jira Software Cloud, if you don't have a Jira project to test against. More information can be found here: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/try
