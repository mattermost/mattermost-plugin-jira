# Mattermost Jira Plugin ![CircleCI branch](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/master.svg) ![Codecov branch](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/master.svg)

This plugin supports a two-way integration between Mattermost and Jira. It is currently in development and not yet considered stable for production. For a stable production release, please download the latest version [in the Releases tab](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases) and follow [this documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/jira.html) for install and configuration.

We are looking for help from our community to complete the development of v2.0 of the Mattermost Jira plugin. If you're interested, review [open Help Wanted issues](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to get started.

## 1. Features

Below is a list of features currently supported. Each is considered Beta and may be removed in subsequent updates. We are also aware of a few known issues and are tracking development [in Jira](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=status%20in%20(%22At%20Risk%22%2C%20Backlog%2C%20%22Future%20Consideration%22%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Open%2C%20Pending%2C%20%22Planned%3A%20Backlog%22%2C%20%22Planned%3A%20Scheduled%22%2C%20Reopened%2C%20Resolved%2C%20Reverted%2C%20%22Selected%20for%20Development%22%2C%20Submitted%2C%20%22To%20Do%22)%20AND%20%22Epic%20Link%22%20%3D%20MM-12474%20ORDER%20BY%20cf%5B10011%5D%20ASC%2C%20created%20DESC).

## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Jira Cloud (Core + Software)

#### 3.1.1 Mattermost

1. Download this binary: https://s3.amazonaws.com/mattermost-public-plugins-kubernetes/jira-test-2.0.0.tar.gz
2. Go to **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Management** and upload the plugin from step 1. If you don't have the ability to upload plugins, uploads may be disabled on your server. To enable them, set **PluginSettings > EnableUploads** to `true` in your `config.json` file.
3. Once uploaded, the Jira plugin will appear in a list of installed plugins. Click **Enable** to enable it.
4. Go to **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Management > Jira**, select the username that this plugin is attached to, generate a **Secret** and hit **Save**.

#### 3.1.2 Jira

As a Jira administrator, you have two steps to configure the plugin:

#### 3.1.3 Jira - Deploy via Jira AppConnect

1. As a Jira System Administrator, go to **Jira Settings > Apps > Manage Apps**. 
  - For older versions of Jira, go to **Administration > Applications > Add-ons > Manage add-ons**

2. Click **Settings** at bottom of page and enable development mode, and apply this change.
  - Enabling development mode allows you to install apps that are not from the Atlassian Marketplace.
  - Mattermost has opted not to publish to Atlassian Marketplace, as we don’t have an efficient way to provide a callback URL for the app in the marketplace, to enable user-specific interactions between the Mattermost server and Jira cloud instance.

3. Click **Upload add-on**, then enter the Atlassian Connect app descriptor in the form https://<SITEURL>/plugins/jira/atlassian-connect.json where `SITEURL` is your [Mattermost Site URL](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#site-url). Select **Upload**.

4. Wait for the app to install.

You're all set. Users can now connect their Mattermost account with Jira using `/jira connect`.

#### 3.1.4 Jira - Configure Webhooks

Only the Jira System Admin has permissions to link a Jira project to a Mattermost channel via webhooks. We are planning to allow anyone with access to subscribe a Jira project to a Mattermost channel via `/jira subscribe`.

1. As a Jira System Administrator, go to **Jira Settings > System > WebHooks**.
  - For older versions of Jira, click the gear icon in bottom left corner, then go to **Advanced > WebHooks**.

2. Click **Create a WebHook** to create a new webhook. Choose a unique name and add the JIRA webhook URL https://SITEURL/plugins/jira/webhook?secret=WEBHOOKSECRET&team=TEAMURL&channel=CHANNELURL as the URL.
  - Make sure to replace `TEAMURL` and `CHANNELURL` with the Mattermost team URL and channel URL you want the JIRA events to post to. The values should be in lower case.
  - Moreover, replace `SITEURL` with the site URL of your Mattermost instance, and `WEBHOOKSECRET` with the secret generated in Mattermost via **System Console > Plugins (Beta) > Jira**

For instance, if the team URL is `contributors`, channel URL is `town-square` and site URL is `https://community.mattermost.com`, and the generated webhook secrete is `5JlVk56KPxX629ujeU3MOuxaiwsPzLwh`, then the final webhook URL would be

```
https://ci-linux-postgres.mattermost.com/plugins/jira/webhook?secret=5JlVk56KPxX629ujeU3MOuxaiwsPzLwh&team=contributors&channel=town-square
```

3. (Optional) Set a description and a custom JQL query to determine which types of tickets trigger events. For more information on JQL queries, refer to the [Atlassian help documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html).

4. Finally, set which issue events send messages to Mattermost channels. The following are supported:

 - Issue: Created, Updated, Deleted
 - Comment: Created, Updated, Deleted

### 3.2 Jira Server (Core + Software)

Documentation to be added.

## 4. Developing

This plugin contains both a server and web app portion.

Use `make dist` to build distributions of the plugin that you can upload to a Mattermost server.
Use `make check-style` to check the style.
Use `make deploy` to deploy the plugin to your local server.

For additional information on developing plugins, refer to [our plugin developer documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/).

To test your changes against Jira locally, we recommend starting a 14-day trial for Jira Software Cloud, if you don't have a Jira project to test against. More information can be found here: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/try
